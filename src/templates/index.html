                                                Ability of computers to understand human speech and written text is an important and complex AI task.
                                                In this workshop you will learn how to tackle Natural Language Processing problems where instead of numbers,
                                                text is an input to the algorithm.

                                                through data preprocessing stages of text mining.
                                                In the end we will get soft intro to Latent Dirichlet Allocation - a popular topic modelling algorithm.

                                            Ability of computers to understand human speech and written text is an important and complex AI task.
                                            In this workshop you will learn how to tackle Natural Language Processing problems where instead of numbers,
                                            text is an input to the algorithm.

                                            We will cover challenges from linguistic perspective and we will go step-by-step
                                            through data preprocessing stages of text mining.
                                            In the end we will get soft intro to Latent Dirichlet Allocation - a popular topic modelling algorithm.

                Women in Tech Oslo (#witoslo) is a non-profit organisation that provides hands on tech workshops.
                Our aim is to build a community where women can strength their skills, decide if a career in tech is for them and make steps up the tech career ladder.
                We welcome men to our space in acknowledging that if women are to succeed in this arena, men are our ally and are welcomed in joining this journey with us.
            </p>
            <p>
                Each workshop leaves participates with new knowledge, applicable skills and something to take home either for their GitHub or their portfolio.
                The goal of our events is to create confidence that anyone can learn programming. That first “aha, I can do that!” moment is crucial for women to choosing the technological pathway. We want you to feel excited, to feel accomplished.
            </p>
            <p>
                We stand for unity across diversity.
